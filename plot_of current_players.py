Collect the names of the 2 batmen currently playing.
Who among them is currently at the non strikerâ€™s end ?
- Collect runs scored for each ball. 
    Make sure, you accumulate runs for the correct player based on who is facing the ball.
- Remember that players change positions at the end of each over. 
- The match ends after 30 balls, or if any batsman scores more than 60 runs.
- Print all the statistics for each batsman
